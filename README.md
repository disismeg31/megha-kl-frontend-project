 # Frontend Project
###Process
- Responsiveness :
   - i implimented responsiveness using plane css and mediaqueries along with flexbox, which provide breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
   - why ? :  used to adjust elements like fonts, buttons, and containers based on the screen size, ensuring consistency and usability.
- Challenges :
   - it was a litlle bit time consuming to do the responsiveness using plane css since for a while i was using tailwind css for styling web apps
- Use of react:
   - i implimented a simple state management using useState hook for handling the form submition of the contact section which allerts the user name and logs the name email and message
